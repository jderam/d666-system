# Character Creation
New characters begin play at level 1 with the following. Record all information on a sheet of paper.
1. You begin play with 3 hit points.
2. Roll for or select 2 [Skills](#skills).
3. Roll for or select 1 [Extraordinary Ability](#extraordinary-abilities).
4. Record equipment from the [Base Equipment Pack](#base-equipment-pack).
5. Roll for 1 [Wearable Item](#wearble-items).
6. Roll for 1 item from each of the **Misc Items** charts ([A](#misc-items-a), [B](#misc-items-b), and [C](#misc-items-c)).
7. Roll for a starting [Weapon](#weapons).
8. Roll 3d6 to determine how many silver pieces (sp) you begin play with.
9. Name your character.
10. (Optional) Add any interesting details about your character's appearance, background, or mannerisms. You may wish to create a sketch of your character as well.

## Character Advancement
For each adventure completed, the character gains a level. 
Note that characters will generally gain more power from magic items and artifacts acquired on their adventures than they will from advancing though levels, but they will gain automatic street cred in the world based on their level.

### ADVANCEMENT CHART
| d6 Roll | Benefit |
|:-------:|---------|
| 1-3     | Gain 1 hit point |
| 4-5     | Gain a Skill |
| 6       | Gain an Extraordinary Ability |

## Skills
Below are the various skills and the summaries of their respective uses.
When you have one of these skills, you only need a 4+ on your check in order to succeed,
whereas a character without the skill would need a 5+.

##### (1-3)
1. **Dungeoneering**: Navigate dungeons and caves, detect grades and slopes, identify subterranean creatures.
2. **Fast-Talk**: Convince another through charisma or subterfuge.
3. **Hypermnesia**: Perfectly recall information the character was previously exposed to.
4. **Intuition**: Discern lies or malicious intent; notice an important detail.
5. **Knowledge**: Awareness of a bit of lore, science, or trivia that may be relevant to the situation.
6. **Legerdemain**: Performing card tricks, picking pockets, and similar.

##### (4-6)
1. **Muscle**: Break down doors, lift heavy things, etc.
2. **Parkour**: Balancing, climbing, jumping, tumbling.
3. **Sneak**: Quietly move or hide without being noticed.
4. **Survival**: Navigate, find food and shelter, track animals and people while in the wilderness.
5. **Tinkering**: Pick locks, set or disarm traps, discern how technological items work. Tools may be required.
6. **Zoophilism**: Ability to calm, empathize with, and communicate in a rudimentary fashion with animals.

## Extraordinary Abilities
These are unique abilities an adventurer can perform that are generally not possible otherwise.  

##### (1-3)
1. **Alchemy**: Mix potions and poisons, provided the necessary ingredients are at hand. Identify unknown liquids with a successful check.
2. **Beastmaster**: Make a check to tame a beast who's hit points don't exceed your own. The pet must be fed and treated well. If ever neglected, or called on to aid in direct combat, another check must be made to prevent the creature from abandoning you. If this ability is taken a second time, or you have the zoophilism skill, the checks are successful on 4+.
3. **Berserks Mode**: You may choose to enter a berserker rage, which lasts until the end of a combat. All attacks are made with disadvantage, but deal double damage on a hit.
4. **Cantraps**: Produce minor, non-damaging magical effects at will.
5. **Diehard**: The first time you fall to 0 hit points in a given day, you immediately gain 1 hit point back and don't lose consciousness.
6. **Healing**: As an action, you can make a check to heal an ally other than yourself. On a success, the target creature is healed for 2 hit points. Alternatively, this ability can also be used to cure poison, disease, and other physical ailments that are non-magical. You must touch the recipient to perform the healing.

##### (3-6)
1. **Read Magic**: Ability to discern arcane writing and cast spells from scrolls. When this ability is gained, the character also gains two randomly determined scrolls (see [**Magic**](04_magic.md)).
2. **Repel Undead**: On a successful check, you add the total of the two dice and turn away that many hit points of undead creatures. May be attempted once per combat.
3. **Vigilant**: Whenever your side loses initiative, make a check. If the check is successful, you act first.
4. **Wizardry**: Knowledge of and ability to cast three randomly determined spells (see [**Magic**](04_magic.md)). This ability may be taken multiple times, and three additional random spells are learned each time.
5. **Perceptive**: You have a chance to notice secret doors or other important yet subtle clues that others would miss. The GM needs to make the checks for this, and may need to be reminded from time to time that you have this ability.
